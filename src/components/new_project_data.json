    "more info": "This software provides a variety of music samples, and gives users the options to apply reverb, distortion, delay, and chorus to said audio effects. The user can also bind each sample to a key on the keyboard and activate the sample by pressing the key. In short, this allows users to essentially play music using just their keyboard! There is also a feature to upload your own samples and add them to a public database. Below is a short demonstration of some of the functionality.",
